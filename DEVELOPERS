WARNING: This is currently just a placeholder with some notes and links. We DO NOT have a verified, recommended implementation template for an alternative TrustManager yet, or even know how it will work. We will provide some more sample code and specific information here shortly. Until then, please look into loading your own KeyStore instance and implementing a custom TrustMnaagerFactory.

This thread on how to implement a TrustManager is useful, but the "All Trusting" model they
demonstrate is not recommended:
