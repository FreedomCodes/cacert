Guardian Project Curated CACert
Created: 2011-09-01

In response to growing concerns about the less-than trustworthy state of the global Certificate Authority ecosystem, we have decided to began curating our own CACert keystore for use on Android devices. The process by which Google and/or the Android project includes or excludes root authorities is not entirely transparent, and the decisions they make may not be in the same interests as ours. In addition, it seems that to modify the CACert.bks file, it would require an Android system update, which tend to happen only on very long intervals.

(More on the "DigiNotar Debacle" here: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-debacle-and-what-you-should-do-about-it)

Our goal with this project is to review all of the included CAs based on what information we can attain about their trustworthiness. We will also respond to public request for removal or inclusion, and strive to keep this curated keystore as up-to-date and relevant as possible.

In addition, we expect to develop a simple utility for rooted Android devices, which can download the latest version, and update the CACerts.bks when updates are made. We also want to reach out to developers of browser applications or other HTTPS or SSL Socket enabled apps for Android, to use this CACert file, embedded in their app, instead of the system default file. We are working to do this in our own apps such as Gibberbot and Orweb today.

We would like to ack WhisperSystems as an inspiration for this, as they were able to push out a small patch through their WhisperCore update tool in order to modify the keystore to remove DigiNotar.
